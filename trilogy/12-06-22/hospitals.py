# Problem Description
# There are N villages located on a straight highway, the highway allows only one directional traffic that is away from the start of the highway.
# The positions of villages are given by an array A, where A‚ÇÅ denotes the distance of village form start of the highway.
# The population of villages are given by another array B.
# Local government wants to build hospitals in C villages such that sum of the minimum distance travelled by every person to reach a hospital is minimum.
# Find minimum sum of distance to travel possible by buliding hospitals optimally in villages.
# Note: There should always be a hospital in the last village that is farthest village from the start of the highway.

# Input Format
# First argument is an integer array A.
# Second arguemnt is an integer array B.
# Third argument is an integer C.
# Output Format
# Return an integer.
# Example Input
# Input 1:
# A = [1, 2, 3]
# B = [1, 2, 3]
# C = 2
# Input 2:
# A = [1, 2, 3]
# B = [1, 2, 3]
# C = 3

# Example Output
# Output 1:
# 1
# Output 2:
# 0
# Example Explanation
# Explanation 1:
# We can build hospitals at the villages 2 and 3.
# The citizens of above two villages doesn't need to travel.
# Citizents of village 1 can go to village 2, thus distance travelled = (3-2)*1 = 1.
# Explanation 2:
# All villages can have their own hospital.
